[IBM (Micromuse) Netcool Omnibus ](http://www-306.ibm.com/software/tivoli/products/netcool-omnibus/) is an event management tool. Omnibus is a proprietary in-memory database and however it leverages Sybase client libraries for communications, therefore it is possible to access to the data stored in relational database tables through JDBC.

The objective of the project is to develop a solution that enables working with the events and other data stored in the Netcool Omnibus server using a scripting language.

Groovy4Netcool is:
  * a platform independent solution (works on any OS with a valid JVM)
  * easy to install and configure, no code compilation, dependencies, etc.
  * leverages a dynamic, easy to use, non-proprietary scripting language that has access to Java libraries

[Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org) is a dynamic scripting language for Java Virtual Machine (JVM).


A google [group](http://groups.google.com/group/groovy4netcool) is created for the project communications.
